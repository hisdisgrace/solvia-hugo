            <p>Big Willy is best known for his work as the trombonist for <strong>FUZIGISH</strong>. Devoted to the performance and production of South African music, he has been a stalwart of the scene for nearly twenty years having joined <strong>LEEK & the Bouncing Uptones</strong> at the spritely age of seventeen.</p>

            <p>Bass guitar is Will’s second instrument and often at the core of his writing. He throttled the bass for <strong>Architecture of Aggression</strong> for most of a decade before joining <strong>The Slashdogs</strong> in 2015.</p>
            <p><strong>SOLVIA</strong> is his vocally driven solo project.</p>
            <p>Will’s debut album, <strong>DIVINORUM</strong>, is the result of seven years spent writing, recording, mixing, mastering and learning. Committed to controlling the entire process, he produced the album from start to finish.</p>
            <p><strong>SOLVIA</strong> embraces the power of digital music production while drawing inspiration from the Rock ‘n Roll majesty of bands such as Black Sabbath and Tool. Socio-political themes, as well as the esoteric, feature strongly on <strong>DIVINORUM</strong>; <em>Nixon’s Nightmare</em> decries the failure and injustice of the war on drugs, <em>Deus Infinitus</em> explores the beauty of dying.</p>
            <p><em>“Creating this album was a deeply moving experience. The next step is to perform it live, a prospect the band is relishing"</em></p>
