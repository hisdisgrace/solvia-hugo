- Oumikami, who is the Sun, once said
- In a language obscure unless you're dead
- Or dying each day (as so you should)
- That metal, fire, water, wind and wood
- And all concerns of a reptile's brain
- Are arrested, turned, and ingested through pain.
- Pain alone bears the wounded torch,
- Along pathways where (crosswise) soft sunflowers
- Scorch our flowering-hours. Never cease to bear
- Our quiet march, through sanity spare
<br>
- Abrade us into another age
- Sandblast our insides until
- We’re washed of indignant fear and rage
- And with forgiveness fill
<br>
- Amaterasu
- I pray you my Sun
- My flaring and only
- Omnipotent one
<br>
- Abrade us of anger
- Abrade us of pride
- Abrade us of fear
- Abrade us of self
<br>
- Why the hell
- Is everyone familiar?
- It’s as if I’ve been you before
- In countless lives
- Forging timeless rivers
- In (all) your eyes
- I see fractal mirrors
<br>
- We’re on the horizon
- A coming of age
- We stand in defiance
- Of entropies rage
<br>
- Abrade us of anger
- Abrade us of pride
- Abrade us of fear
- Abrade us of self
<br>
- Why the hell
- Is everyone familiar?
- It’s as if I’ve been you before
- In countless lives
- Forging timeless rivers
- In (all) your eyes
- I see fractal mirrors

Written from a poem by my dear friend and wordsmith-extraordinaire, Etienne Fourie, My Only Prayer, captures a grand view of humanities purpose. Evolution is a painful process, riddled with suffering, death and extinction, but it is through the abrasion of our baser instincts that humanity edges forward. A web of consciousness that transcends any one of us - In all your eyes I see fractal mirrors.
