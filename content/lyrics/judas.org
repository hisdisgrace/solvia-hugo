- Now that you’re here I think that we should have a talk
- You’ve been up to mischief again
- Those who carry secrets find their souls wearing thin
- Heavy you’ll struggle my friend
<br>
- How many times did you choose to bite your tongue?
- Then wretched in silence you spoke
- Ambitions of vengeance and whispers of hate
- Careful, I fear that you’ll choke
<br>
- We need to feel all of this pain from both sides
- No one is clean we have all sold lies
<br>
- I can’t face you
- I can’t speak
- Let me plot in shadow
- You make me weak
- All I want is
- What you’ve got
- But this righteous envy
- Has caused my soul to rot

Judas is painted as a villain by history but it was Gods will that made him the scapegoat. This track explores the nature of betrayal, shining light on both sides of the experience. We are far too willing to cut people off because they have wronged us. Betrayal, in all its guises, is part of being human.
