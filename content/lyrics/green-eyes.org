- She is greed and
- She is envy
- Know her lust
- She’ll bleed you empty
- She’ll possess you
- You won’t notice
- She’ll obsess you
- You’ll lose focus
<br>
- Keep on smiling
- She won’t lose you
- Keep on smiling
- Like you used to
- That’s a good boy
- Don’t you question
- Insecure mental projection
<br>
- Come rest you look far too weary
- You’ve been crusading for far too long
- Come lay your head on the pillow
- I know that you’re only so strong
- There’s no trophy worth all this pain
- Yet you go back again and again
- There’s still time for you to let go
<br>
- She has needs and Now she needs you
- No one’s perfect
- Who could blame you?
- After all you’re
- Only human
- Still a slave to
- Evolution
<br>
- She’ll possess you
- You won’t notice
- She’ll obsess you
- You’ll lose focus
- Lost inside her
- Web of dreaming
- Deaf and blind your
- Soul is screaming
<br>
- Come rest you look far too weary
- You’ve been crusading for far too long
- Come lay your head on the pillow
- I know that you’re only so strong
- There’s no trophy worth all this pain
- Yet you go back again and again
- There’s still time for you to let go

For some people its money... for others its addiction... perhaps it may be love. The reptilian core of the problem is the same – a deep voice ceaselessly whispering insecure thoughts.
