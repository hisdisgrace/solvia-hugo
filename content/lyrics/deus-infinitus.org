- Everyone must die someday
- No exceptions no one stays
- Let it be if I must go
- Leave this only world I know
<br>
- One last breath
- Fades to death
- But I’m not dead
- I’m just not breathing
- Now I fly
- Ten dimensional skies
- Consciousness
- A waking dream
<br>
- And I feel fine
-  Outside time
- I’m alive I’m just not
- Breathing
- I see your eyes
- Crying lies
- You were
- Born to
- Cry
<br>
- YOU ARE
- Born innocent and
-  PERFECT
- Divine in every
-  ASPECT
- Your life a thread of
- This ETERNAL
<br>
- You can’t see me
- Though I still hear you
- From a space where living life
- Is just a dream
<br>
- SEE THERE
- Are more stars in
- THE SKY

- ON EARTH
- We are 
- SENTIENT STAR DUST
<br>

<br>
- Breath in the air
- Nothings to fear
- Down by the Lake
- View the heavens so clear
- Just passing the time
- So little time
- So much there to live for
- So hard to see why
<br>
- DEATH COMES
- Relentless and
- UNCARING
- Ripping you from
- BEING
- No time or mind to
- Chain or hold you
<br>
- Once again I’m seeing
- This is glorious

<br>

- Are more stars in
- THE SKY
= Than grains of sand
- ON EARTH
- We are
- SENTIENT STAR DUST
- DEUS INFINITUS 
- IM COMING HOME

-----

The concept of “God” is all encompassing- there is nothing that is not “God”. With more stars in the sky than grains of sand on earth and the very real possibility of infinite dimensions/universes, we find ourselves utterly in awe of the majesty and magnitude of what we are a part of. That kind of thinking can make you feel small and insignificant but it also gives one an incredible sense of belonging. Deus Infinitus is a celebration of Eternity, the Universe, Life and Death itself.
