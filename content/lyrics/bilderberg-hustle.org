- What have we done?
- What have we done?
- This government no longer serves everyone
- Only fat cats in office and all of their friends
- With their tenders and new cars and platinum rings
<br>
- It’s a goddamn shame
- How they’ve fallen from grace
- I see bribes and corruption all over the place
- And it’s blatant and glaring and thrown in our face
- It’s hard bearing witness to such a disgrace
<br>
- Silver tongue!
- The money it speaks
- It searches out those who are dirty and weak
- Then it buys them and binds them with monstrous technique
- All over the world it’s the bane of the meek
<br>
- I know
- There’s no escape from this trouble
- Nowhere to go
- Until
- Those who bear office do so without coveting gold

- It pains my soul how
- It’s always the same
- All over the world they all play the same game
- In the US and England and Russia and Spain
- In Egypt and China, Israel and Ukraine
<br>
- Bilderberg!
- Subtle & Sly
- Vote for whoever you’d least like to die
- Cause there’s no choice like no choice like no choice at all
- We don’t care who you vote for we bought them all!
<br>
- I know
- There’s no escape from this trouble
- Nowhere to go
- Until
- Those who bear office do so without coveting gold

The greatest problem I feel humanity is currently facing is the influence of big money and corporate interests on our democratic process. South Africans are well aware of corruption, it’s something we are exposed to every day, but the problem is entirely global. The separation of church and state was a great achievement but what we desperately need now is a true separation of finance and state.
